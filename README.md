# jQuery-Anchor-Margin
Put a margin on clicked href targets - useful for sites with fixed headers, which by default would cover the clicked element's target

Pass in the element to use as the height. Multiple elements can be comma separated, and their heights will be added together.

### Usage
```
$('a').anchormargin({element: "#header-wrapper, #wpadminbar"});
```
